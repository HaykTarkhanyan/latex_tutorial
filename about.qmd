About this site


## Markdown

Markdown is an easy to read and write text format:

- It's _plain text_ so works well with version control
- It can be **rendered** into HTML, PDF, and more
- Learn more at: <https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/>

## Code Cell

Here is a Python code cell:

```{python}
import time 
import random

print(time.time())
print(random.randint(1,100))
```

## Equation

Use LaTeX to write equations:

$$
\chi' = \sum_{i=2}^n k_i s_i^2
$$
